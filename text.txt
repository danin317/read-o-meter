Since I have severely procrastinated today (when it comes to personal projects, that is), to not feel bad I decided to create a 
little script that calculates the estimated reading time of a text. (and of course, outputs it to Markdown because I want to feel 
fancy)

If you're interested, the source code can be found here, but the code is not even 20 lines in 
length, it really is that simple. 

So yeah, from now on you can see how long the blog post will be before reading it.
